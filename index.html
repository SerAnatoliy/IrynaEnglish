I feel especially good when I see that the website I created works perfectly. That’s the best reward for me! I've gained a lot of practical experience and become intimately familiar with several coding languages. Also, I participated in coding challenges and worked on personal coding projects. I'm excited to begin a career as a front-end developer and learn more about this line of work from industry professionals."</h3>
